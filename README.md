# 🌊 Fish Marine Analysis

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates SQL skills by cleaning and analyzing a marine fish dataset. The dataset includes information on species, regions, fishing methods, and environmental factors.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Clean the dataset** to ensure consistency and accuracy.
- **Perform SQL analysis** to uncover trends in fish populations, overfishing risks, and pollution levels.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Marine Fish Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arifmia/marine-fish-dataset)
- **File:** `Marine_Fish_Data.csv`

## 📊 Key Insights
- Regions with the highest fish populations.
- Trends in overfishing risks and pollution.
- Seasonal breeding patterns of marine species.
- Impact of pollution on fish population and size.

## 🛠️ How to Replicate
1. Import `Marine_Fish_Data.csv` into MySQL Workbench.
2. Run the SQL script `marine_fish_analysis.sql` to clean and analyze the dataset.
3. Analyze the results using the queries provided in the script.
